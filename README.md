# Quadrant Raking
== A 2D Tier List made with Python + Tkinter ==

**Quadrant Ranking** is a Python application built with Tkinter that allows you to create two-dimensional tier lists. Unlike traditional tier lists that rank items along a single axis, Quadrant Ranking lets you evaluate items along both X and Y axes, providing a more nuanced visualization of how items relate to each other.
